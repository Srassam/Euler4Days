# Euler4Days
A passion project to practice the good code and solve problems.

Thoughts:

Post bootcamp has been filled with refresher of the program, redoing projects and relearning concepts that I did not grasp the first time.

Problem:

I set out to commit up to 10x a day to create a habit and also show that I am committed to the code. There are so many things to work on, update and practice. I want to commit but also work on some white board problems.

Solution:

Create a repo to push to while practicing white board problems. At this point working out problems in the terminal, noting how to go about the the poblem and steps took to solve. By doing it this way I will commit, save white board problems and solutions, all to create a good habbit.
